# Day 5: Interactive Modal Window ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to *Day 5* of my 100-day JavaScript learning journey! ðŸš€

In this project, I've built an *interactive modal window* using *HTML, **CSS, and **JavaScript*. This simple yet functional design demonstrates my progress in DOM manipulation, responsive design, and event handling.

## ðŸ“¸ Preview
Here's what the modal window looks like:
